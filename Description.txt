## Description of version 14
Final phase: when all tiles have been drawn rules change
Expand main window. only sizing is not perfect
Added Network_error so that we know when there is no conenction. 
When no connection I skip waitingRoom (though I get a warning/error in the console). 
When no connection cfg.name is created in Network_error and passed to preSolitaire.
Added Quit button to preSolitaire
Fixed bugs with player name. Now leaving the text area updates the name
Fixed bug when quitting waiting room. Now server gets notified of quitting players
Structure reviewed (e.g. launch methods in server.py and tantrix.py)
Client regularly pings server to ensure presence. Server deletes lost clients and updates waiting room
